Welcome to my blog!

I decided to create a blog so I could have a place to discuss and document my experiences with school, coding, and life in general.
I plan on sharing code snippets from experiments I conduct in hope that it could help other developpers in the future (or even my forgetful self).

It's also nice to have a piece of me that I can come back to to check on my progress over the years. I'll be mostly discussing the topics of web dev, game dev, and whatever else i get interested in in the future :)

Enjoy!
